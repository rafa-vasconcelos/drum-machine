## Overview

This is a Drum Machine App that you can use as a digital musical instrument! 

The way you play it is pretty simple: you either click on each of the nine buttons  or you press the assigned hotkey for each button ('Q', 'W', 'E'...) and it will activate a sound.

Every time a button is pressed/clicked the description of the sound played will be shown in the display next to it so you'll know exactly which kind of sound you are playing.

Futhermore, on the controls section of the machine you are able to turn it on and off using the Power toggle; you can set the volume using the Volume slider; and you can select one of two different set of sounds pressing the Bank toggle.

## Technologies Used

This project was mainly written with React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Sass was also used.

## Future improvements

This is the final version of the app, functionality-wise. Small design improvements may be added in the future. Improvements in code readability and refactoring of the code may also be implemented.
